### 2. Design Rationale
From our contextual inquiry, we know that the website that is used as our topic lacks layout coordinations. The design is also inspired from prticipant's action and reaction on doing the contextual inquiry, which shows hard time when doing the task given among the most of them. So we make the content more visible to common people's eyes by adding some new layouts, grouping the buttons with similar functionality, adding a short but helping text, and so on.   


## Part B: Assumptions

### 1. Hardware
```
Expected hardware: a PC / laptop accomodated with mouse or touch pad, with colored 1366x768 screen. 
Pretty much a standard one.

```

### 2. Users
```
Expected user: A novice on using laptop / PC, using web browser, familiar with internet, 
interested in Papua Province

```
